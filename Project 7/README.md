# Using XQuery
The purpose of this project is to learn XQuery.

The following queries were expressed using XQuery and run against the file, auction.xml, using Zorba:

1.	Print the number of items listed on all continents

2.	List the names of items registered in Europe along with their descriptions

3.	List the names of persons and the number of items they bought

4.	List all persons according to their interest (ie, for each interest category, display the persons on that category)

5.	Group persons by their categories of interest and output the size of each group

6.	List the names of persons and the names of the items they bought in Europe

7.	Give an alphabetically ordered list of all items along with their location

8.	List the reserve prices of those open auctions where a certain person with id person3 issued a bid before another person with id person6.

Each answer is enclosed in <queryx> </queryx> tags - where x is the question number (1…8).
