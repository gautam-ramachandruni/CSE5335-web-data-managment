# Using XPath and XSLT
The goal of this project is to learn XPath and XSLT to query XML data.

The XPATH.java file answers the following queries:

1.	Print the titles of all articles whose one of the authors is David Maier

2.	Print the titles of all articles whose first author is David Maier

3.	Print the titles of all articles whose authors include David Maier and Stanley B. Zdonik

4.	Print the titles of all articles in volume 19/number 2

5.	Print the titles and the init/end pages of all articles in volume 19/number 2 whose authors include Jim Gray

6.	Print the volume and number of all articles whose authors include David Maier

The XSLT program, recipe.xsl, displays the recipes nicely on a web browser. The XSLT generates HTML code. The program, xslt.java, was used to test the XSLT and then the resulting html output file was loaded onto the web browser.
