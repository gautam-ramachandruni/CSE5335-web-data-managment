<li>olive oil</li>
            amount: 2&nbsp;
            tablespoon<br>
<li>spaghetti sauce</li>
            amount: 1&nbsp;
            jar<br>
<li>shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            amount: 0.5&nbsp;
            cup<br>
<li>angel hair pasta</li>
            amount: 12&nbsp;
            ounce<br>
<li>minced garlic</li>
            amount: 2&nbsp;
            teaspoon<br>
<li>butter</li>
            amount: 0.25&nbsp;
            cup<br>
</ul>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol>
<li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
      </li>
<li>
        Cut cube steak into serving size pieces. Coat meat with the bread crumbs
        and parmesan cheese. Heat olive oil in a large frying pan, and saute 1
        teaspoon of the garlic for 3 minutes. Quick fry (brown quickly on both sides)
        meat. Place meat in a casserole baking dish, slightly overlapping edges.
        Place onion rings and peppers on top of meat, and pour marinara sauce
        over all.
      </li>
<li>
        Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 45 minutes, depending on
        the thickness of the meat. Sprinkle mozzarella over meat and leave in the
        oven till bubbly.
      </li>
<li>
        Boil pasta al dente. Drain, and toss in butter and 1 teaspoon garlic. For a
        stronger garlic taste, season with garlic powder. Top with grated parmesan
        and parsley for color. Serve meat and sauce atop a mound of pasta!
      </li>
</ol>
<br>Comment: 
      Make the meat ahead of time, and refrigerate over night, the acid in the
      tomato sauce will tenderize the meat even more. If you do this, save the
      mozzarella till the last minute.

        Roll out 2 of the balls to fit into the pie pans. Do not make the crust too thick
        as it will expand during cooking and get too thick. Do not flute the edges of
        the dough. Roll out the other 2 balls of dough and cut each into 8 narrow
        strips for the top of the crust. Alternately you can use cookie cutters and
        place the cutouts on the top of the pies.

        Pour the filling evenly into the pie crusts. Top each pie with 8 narrow strips
        of dough or cookie cut-outs. Brush top of pie with milk for shine. Place foil on
        the edge of crust.
