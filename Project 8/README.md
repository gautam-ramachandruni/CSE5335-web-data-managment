# Using Cloud Storage
The goal of this project is to develop a photo-album application that uses cloud storage. More specifically, Dropbox API is used to create a photo album, in which a user can upload, delete, and browse photographs.

The script, album.php, supports the following operations:

• A form to upload a new image (a *.jpg)

•	A display window that lists the names of the images in the dropbox directory. For each image name there is a link that, when clicked, it downloads and displays the image in the image section. Each image name also has a button to delete this image from the dropbox storage

•	An image section that displays the current image

On Mac systems, the program will execute properly only if the permissions for the project folder has "everyone" set to "Write Only (Dropbox)".
